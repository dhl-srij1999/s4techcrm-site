GitHub Pages deployment (recommended):
1. Create a new repository (e.g., s4techcrm-site) and push all files to the `main` branch.
2. In GitHub repo -> Settings -> Pages:
   - Source: Deploy from a branch
   - Branch: main, folder: / (root)
3. Optionally set a custom domain and add a CNAME file with your domain name to the repo root.
